		<h1> 1 - Wireless Mouse</h1>
			<h2>Connectivity</h2>
			<p>Most wireless mice use radio frequency (RF) technology to communicate information to your computer. ... The receiver, which is connected to your computer, accepts the signal, decodes it and passes it on to the mouse driver software and your computer's operating system.</p>

			<h2>Price</h2>
			<p>Average Price Between $5 - $10</p>

			<h2>Performance</h2>
			<p>Dots per inch (DPI) is a measurement of how sensitive a mouse is. The higher a mouse's DPI, the farther the cursor on your screen will move when you move the mouse. A mouse with a higher DPI setting detects and reacts to smaller movements. A higher DPI isn't always better</p>

			<h2>Technology</h2>
			<p>An optical mouse is a computer mouse which uses a light source, typically a light-emitting diode (LED), and a light detector, such as an array of photodiodes, to detect movement relative to a surface. ... The earliest optical mice detected movement on pre-printed mousepad surfaces.</p>

			<h2>Popularity</h2>
			<p>Very Popular, almost every PC have a mouse, except laptops or touchscreen devices.</p>
